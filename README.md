# NBA Schedule Project by Aidan Reyes

This project uses code in R to break down and investigate schedule difficulty among teams in the NBA, using schedule datasets from the 2014-15 season to the 2024-25 season. The .csv datasets of this project provide schedule information such as the date, home / away team, and team stats from the game (with the exception of the 2024-25 season). There is also a locations dataset provided to detail each team's longitude, latitude, and timezone. 

Definitions for the terms used in these datasets can be found at in the data dictionary file. 

The ZIP file provided above includes HTML files that display both the code chunks and observations for each question. These give a detailed summary of my findings with the code (e.g. what is the best part of OKC's 2024 schedule, what BKN's defensive eFG % was in 2024, etc.) The R Markdown HTML file will also provide an interactive schedule graph (with the plotly package) that visualizes OKC and DEN's 2024-25 season schedules, showing game date, opponent, home/away status, and whether or not it is a back-to-back.
