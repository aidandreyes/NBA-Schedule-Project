# NBA Schedule Project by Aidan Reyes

This project uses code in R to break down and investigate schedule difficulty among teams in the NBA, using schedule datasets from the 2014-15 season to the 2024-25 season. The datasets of this project provide schedule information such as the date, home / away team, and team stats from the game (with the exception of the 2024-25 season). There is also a locations dataset provided to detail each team's longitude, latitude, and timezone. 

A dictionary for the terms used in these datasets can be found at https://github.com/aidandreyes/NBA-Schedule-Project/blob/main/data_dictionary.md.
